				<span>I hate Women.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my Nerves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are the Domestic ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the worst.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every moment is packed with Happiness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They breathe deeply</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And walk with large strides, eternally hurrying home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see about dinner.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who say, with a tender smile, “Money’s not everything.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always confronting me with dresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “I made this myself!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They read Woman’s pages and try out the recipes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how I hate that kind of women.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the human Sensitive Plants</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Bundles of Nerves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are different from everybody else; they even tell you so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Someone is always stepping on their feelings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything hurts them⁠—deeply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their eyes are forever filling with tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They always want to talk to me about the Real Things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The things that Matter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes, they know they could write.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conventions stifle them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always longing to get away⁠—Away from It All!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—I wish to Heaven they would.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the Well-Informed ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are pests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know everything on earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will tell you about it gladly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They feel it their mission to correct wrong impressions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know Dates and Middle names.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They absolutely ooze Current Events.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how they bore me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the ones who simply cannot Fathom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why all the men are mad about them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say they’ve tried and tried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you about someone’s husband;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What he said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how he looked when he said it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they sigh and ask,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My dear, what is there about me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Don’t you hate them?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the unfailingly Cheerful ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are usually unmarried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always busy making little Gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And planning little surprises.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell me to be, like them, always looking on the Bright Side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ask me what they would do without their sense of humor?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sometimes yearn to kill them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Any jury would acquit me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I hate women.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my Nerves.</span>

				<span>A wild and wicked gunman⁠—one who held a gang in thrall⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A menace to the lives of me and you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was counting up, exultingly, the day’s successful haul⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gunmen are extremely apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A string of pearls, a switch or two, a roll of bills, a ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some pocketbooks⁠—about a dozen, say⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An emerald tiara⁠—oh, a very pretty thing!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yes, really, quite a gratifying day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dainty little débutante came trippingly along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wistful, trusting eyes of baby blue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She softly hummed a fragment of a most Parisienne song⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As débutantes are very apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wild and wicked gunman felt he couldn’t miss the chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To end his busy day triumphantly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though scarcely in the habit of attacking débutantes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your money or your life, my dear,” said he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The dainty little débutante was trembling with alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appealingly she looked him through and through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid her helpless little hand upon his brawny arm⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As débutantes are very apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then earnestly she prayed the wicked gunman to be good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She begged that he’d reform that very day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he dropped his wicked gun, and promised that he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade her go her sweet and harmless way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wild and wicked gunman sat considering it all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“At last,” he cried, “I’ve met my Waterloo”;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He vowed he’d give to charity the day’s successful haul⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gunmen are extremely apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he tried to find his gains and give to those in want⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pocketbooks, the watches, bills and ring⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found, to his amazement, that the little débutante</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had taken every solitary thing!</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Lady in Back</h2>
			<p>
				<span>I don’t know what her name is, for you see, we’ve never met;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I don’t know if she’s dark, or if she’s fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know if she’s young or old, or rich or poor⁠—and yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever place I chance to go, she’s there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know where she came from, and I don’t know where she’ll go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why Fate has linked our lives I cannot see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world’s so full of people⁠—oh, I’d really like to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why must she <em>always</em> sit in back of me?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She’s always right on duty when I go to see a play⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfailingly, she’s seen that play before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so she tells what’s coming, in her entertaining way⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For me, the drama holds surprise no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now watch, the husband enters, as I told you that he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At first you’ll think he’ll shoot her, but he’ll not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And later she goes back to him, and says that she’ll be good,”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obligingly she thus unfolds the plot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When I am at the opera, of course she’s sure to come.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She there adopts another policy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more familiar arias she feels obliged to hum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And always just a trifle off the key.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the singers reach those heights to which she can not climb⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh, then I plumb the very depths of gloom!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, lest I be too happy, she will occupy that time</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By long accounts of who’s in love with whom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I never can avoid her at the humble picture show⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of course, the film is always one she’s seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reliable as Mary’s lamb, she’s right behind, I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revealing all the secrets of the screen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When heroes tumble over cliffs, as movie heroes will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And villains blow up bridges, just for fun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know that she takes pleasure in extinguishing my thrill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By telling just exactly how it’s done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I really couldn’t tell you if she’s widow, maid, or wife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ve never heard about her family;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know who appointed her to take the joy from life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can’t imagine why she sees in me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I often sit and think of it, and wonder why it’s so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why, every place that I am, she is too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole wide world to choose from⁠—oh, I’d really like to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why can’t she <em>sometimes</em> sit in back of you?</span>

				<span>They end by appearing in a piece of court plaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carrying a fan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the audience has to stand up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The band is always considered a success</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they climb into a flower-wreathed swing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swing out over the orchestra⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, that I might be there when the ropes break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND there are the Emotional Ones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ones who say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I’ll have two lumps of sugar in my tea, please,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In exactly the same tones as they deliver their hair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yes, he’ll wail murdered him!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever tearing their hair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hope it hurts them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always thinking.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Usually of the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hurl themselves on the floor at his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say that they wish it were all over⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They said something.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are the child Actresses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who should be seen and not heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around telling people about Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they were special correspondents.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always climbing up on innocent bystanders</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And calling them they look so sad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They eternally bring their fathers and mothers together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is always an error of judgment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around patting people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then kneel down beside the orchestra leader,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say their prayers to the spotlight man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish I were Commodore Gerry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I hate Actresses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my nerves.</span>

			<p>
				<span>I hate Relatives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cramp my style.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are Aunts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even the best of us have them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always popping in for little visits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when you ask them to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take it seriously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never fail to tell you how badly you look;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they relate little anecdotes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About friends of theirs who went into Declines.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their conversation consists entirely of Insides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are never out of a Critical Condition.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always posing for X-Ray portraits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of parts of their anatomy with names like parlor-cars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say the doctor tells them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they have only one chance in a hundred⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The odds aren’t big enough.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are In-Laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Necessary Evils of Matrimony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only things they don’t say about you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are the ones they can’t pronounce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No matter what you do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know a better way to do it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are eternally searching your house for dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they can’t find any,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a wasted day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always getting their feelings hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that they can go around with martyred expressions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say that you will appreciate them when they’re gone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You certainly will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are Nephews;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the lowest form of animal life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever saying bright things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is no known force that can keep them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From reciting little pieces about Our Flag.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have the real Keystone sense of humor⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always firing things off in your ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pulling away the chair you are about to sit on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever you are striving to impress anyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They always appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And try out the new words they learned from the ice-man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish the Government would draft all males under ten!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND then there are Husbands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The White Woman’s Burden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never notice when you wear anything new⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You have to point it out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you about the deal they put through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the approach they made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you are supposed to get all worked up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always hanging around outside your door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are incessantly pulling out watches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saying, “Aren’t you dressed yet?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were never known to be wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything is always your fault.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whenever you go out to have a good time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You always meet them⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish to Heaven somebody would alienate their affections.</span>

				<span>THERE are the Conscientious Objectors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the real German atrocities.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around saying, “War is a terrible thing,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were an original line.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take the war as a personal affront;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They didn’t start it⁠—and that lets them out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They point out how much harder it is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stay at home and take care of their consciences</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to go and have some good, clean fun in a nice, comfortable trench.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They explain that it isn’t a matter of mere bravery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They only wish they had the chance to suffer for their convictions⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hope to God they get their wish!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are the Socialists;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Professional Bad Sports.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They don’t want to have any fun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anybody else has more than two dollars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They consider it a criminal offense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They look as if the chambermaid forgot to dust them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is something about their political views</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes them wear soiled décolleté shirts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are too full of the spirit of brotherhood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ask any fellow creature to cut their hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always telling their troubles to the New Republic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forever blocking the traffic with parades.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anyone disagrees with them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They immediately go on strike.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will prove⁠—with a street corner and a soap box⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the whole darned war was Morgan’s fault⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boy, page an alienist.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are the Pacifists;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have chronic stiff necks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From turning the other cheek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say they don’t believe in war⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were Santa Claus or the Stork.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will do anything on earth to have peace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except go out and win it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the only people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who disapprove of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everybody else thinks it’s perfectly great⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Allies are only fighting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because it keeps them out in the open air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know that if we’d all go around wearing lilies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And simply refusing to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Kaiser would take his army and go right back home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s all wrong, Pershing, it’s all wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND then there are the Men of Affairs;</span>

				<span>The ones who are too busy to fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Business is too good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men aren’t needed yet, anyway⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wait till the Germans come over here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you it would be just their luck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose an eye or four fingers in a training camp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then have peace declared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It isn’t as if they hadn’t dependents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wives’ relatives can barely buy tires for the Rolls-Royce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of course, they may be called in the draft,</span>

				<span>The Inventors of the Nude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always gesticulating with their thumbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sketching, with forks, on table cloths;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They point out all the different colors in a sunset</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they were trying to sell it to you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever messing around with batik;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hanging yellow tassels on things;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stencilling everything within reach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do hope that Gibson never learns what they think of him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It would simply break his heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of course, they know that being hung in the Academy</span>

				<span>They say that James Montgomery Flagg may stoop to mere success,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as for them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them starve first!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair enough!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are the Writers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Press Agents for Sex.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever exposing their inmost souls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their “stuff” is always “brutally frank”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, they’d just as soon tell you their favorite flower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They find their fullest expression in free verse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They call it that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because they have to give it away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are extremely well read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They can quote from their own works for hours⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without a mistake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always pulling manuscripts out of their pockets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And asking you to tell them, honestly⁠—is it too daring?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would sit down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And write the Great American Novel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they only could find a publisher Big Enough.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, well⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Genius is an infinite capacity for giving pains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are the Actors;</span>

				<span>They always refer to themselves as “Players”.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever two or three of them are gathered together</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another little theatre comes into the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are eternally leasing vacant kitchenettes</span>

				<span>And presenting their own dramas⁠—with Woolworth scenery.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of course, there can be no real drama above Fourteenth Street.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they even walked across Times Square</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’d feel that they had lost their amateur standing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ask you what you think of their technique,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then wait for you to commit perjury.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thank God that they never descended to commercialism;</span>

				<span>They know that they’ll never be appreciated⁠—</span>

				<span>They don’t know the half of it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND then there are the Radicals;</span>

				<span>The Table D’Hôte Bolsheviki.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always in revolt about something.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing has been done yet that they can wholly approve of.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their existence is just like Heaven⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever starting magazines</span>

				<span>And letting the Postal Authorities put the finish to them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their one ambition is to get themselves arrested,</span>

				<span>So that they can come out and be Heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always stifled⁠—</span>

				<span>Always longing to loose the trivial fetters of Convention,</span>

				<span>I hate the office;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It cuts in on my social life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE is the Art Department;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cover Hounds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always explaining how the photographing machine works.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they stand around in the green light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look as if they had been found drowned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever discovering Great Geniuses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never fail to find exceptional talents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any feminine artist under twenty-five.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever the illustrations are late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fault invariably lies with the editorial department.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always rushing around looking for sketches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And writing mysterious numbers on the backs of photographs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cutting out pictures and pasting them into scrapbooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they say nobody can realize how hard they are worked⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They said something.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there is the Editorial Department;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Literary Lights.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are just a little holier than other people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because they can write classics about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Brevity is the soul of lingerie,’ said this little chemise to itself”;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Here are five reasons for the success of the Broadway plays”.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are all full of soul;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Someone is forever stepping on their temperaments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are constantly having nervous breakdowns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And going away for a few weeks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they only come in on Saturday mornings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hold the franchise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you what good training editorial work is.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they don’t mean to stay in it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some day they will be Free Lances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And write the Great Thoughts that Surge within them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say they only wish they could get away from the office⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes it unanimous.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there is the Fashion Department;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First Aids to Baron de Meyer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any garment costs less than $485</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They think you ought to give it to the Belgians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They look at everything you have on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then smile tolerantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say, “Sears, Roebuck certainly do a wonderful business, don’t they?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever taking pictures of prominent Wild Women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dressed as brides and kneeling at Property Altars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they write essays on Smart Fashions for Limited Incomes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sky’s the limit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE is the Boss;</span>
				<br/>

				<span>I hope he’s satisfied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He has some bizarre ideas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About his employees’ getting to work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At nine o’clock in the morning⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they were a lot of milkmen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He has never been known to see you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When you arrive at 8:45,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But try to come in at a quarter past ten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he will always go up in the elevator with you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He goes to Paris on the slightest provocation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nobody knows why he has to stay there so long.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, well⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You can’t expect to keep him down on the farm.</span>

			<p>
				<span>I hate Actors;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ruin my evenings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the Juveniles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Male Ingenues.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have discovered the rôles of wealthy young sportsmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that they can come running on in white flannels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carrying tennis racquets, and wearing spiked shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever the lights go up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are discovered with their arms around some girl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They wear their wrist watches with abandon on their stage wrists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they simply couldn’t play a scene without their cigarette cases.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They think that the three Greatest Names in American History</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are Hart, Schaffner, and Marx.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are constantly giving interviews to the Sunday papers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Complaining about the carloads of mash notes they receive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know they have it in them to do something Really Big;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are impatient to tackle all them that they would go far⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the Movie Heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Boys Who Drove the Wild West Wild.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were forever furling out into the sunset,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if they can’t pose for a close-up every few feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They lose their company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They wear their hair bobbed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And always look as if they dressed by mail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They move across the stage like a flock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole troupe of supernumeraries hasn’t a chance against them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are just bubbling over with animal spirits⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are continually walking up the side of houses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or springing from one galloping horse to another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or jumping out of balloons, without parachutes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are so full of health that when they come on foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the extreme edge of the Grand Canyon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the Arrowtipe after them, they never</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the Tragedians;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Ones Who Made Shakespeare famous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always telling what they used to say to Booth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they talk about the old traditions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they had collaborated on them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They make their positively last appearance, semi-annually,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are just about to go on farewell tour <abbr>No.</abbr> 118397, Series <abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr></span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never appear in any rôle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which they have to wear long trousers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they stooped to play in any drama written after 1700,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know that Art could never be the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever striding around the stage in trick tempests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearing aluminum armor, and waving property swords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrieking at Heaven to do its worst⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish Heaven would kindly oblige.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there are the Drawing-Room Stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Ones That Swing a Mean Tea-Cup.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They always appear in those dramas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which the Big Line is “No cream, please⁠—lemon.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They interest every emotion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By tapping the left thumb-nail with the cork-tipped cigarette.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are invariably the best-dressed men on our stage⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their press-agent says so himself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always standing in the center of the stage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying cutting things about marriage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they hang around in property moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making middle-aged love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cherish secret ambitions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take off their cutaways and play Hamlet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know they could be great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the public would only give them their just due⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If it only would!</span>

			<p>
				<span>There are the Symptom Collectors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have tried every specialist once.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go about, quoting what they said under ether;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They give readings from their fever-charts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they carry their cast-off appendixes with them, in bottles⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just for old times’ sake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever showing you X-ray photographs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their quaint crannies and intimate inglenooks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say that you can never guess what they suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they clear up all doubts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every doctor tells them that their case is hopeless⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll say it is.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the Parlor Comedians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have memorized the entire series</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of history’s favorite anecdotes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They begin by saying that they just heard a new one⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is the funniest line in the whole story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go in strongly for the kind of humor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That requires special apparatus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will go miles to procure an exploding cigar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a perforated drinking-glass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have a repertoire of sure-fire comedy hits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They address all waiters as “George,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they love to call you on the telephone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say, “This is Police Headquarters speaking.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They save up all their witticisms for you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell you how everyone nearly dies at them⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearly dies is right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the Gluttons for Business.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They started on a shoe string</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worked their way up to white spats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are entirely self-made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And think that everybody is clamoring for the recipe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their life is an open ledger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you all the inside gossip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About invoices and bills of lading,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And illustrate their talk with diagrams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showing their increased output throughout the Middle West.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They relate heart-rending stories</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of how they haven’t had a vacation in ten years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how they wish they could go away for a while⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I wish they could go away from now on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there are the Amateur Mediums.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always fooling around with the spirits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are constantly receiving messages from the Great Beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying Uncle Walter is well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hopes everybody at home is the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They spend every night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being warned, in dreams, of their friends’ deaths.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is nothing that they can’t worm out of a ouija board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are so messy around the house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always tipping tables</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sitting around in circles, with the lights out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever seeing things and hearing knocks,</span>

			<p>
				<span>GLAD Christmas Day once more has come⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There’s little novelty in that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s welcomed eagerly by some,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which isn’t to be marveled at.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their stockings hold a house and lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I hope you gather what I mean),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A picturesquely furnished yacht,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A next year’s model limousine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sable wrap of graceful cut,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sheaf of cheques for vast amounts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s not the thought that matters, but</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gift which goes with it that counts.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<em>But I’LL get a multitude of seasonable cards,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>A bowl full of lily bulbs, approaching their decease;</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<em>A pair of gilded shoe-trees, with appropriate regards,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>And a leather-bound “Evangeline,” with colored frontispiece.</em>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It’s scarcely any wonder that</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The season finds me all unmoved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Father Christmas leaves me flat⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Step-Father Christmas, it has proved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas ever thus⁠—from early youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ve seen my hopes decay, because</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too soon I learned the bitter truth:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There isn’t any Santa Claus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each Yuletide mocks my touching trust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though give and let give is my plea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s Christmas Day for some, but just</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">December twenty-fifth for me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<em>For I’LL get a paper-weight, to crush my Christmas cheer,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>A hand-painted needle-case, a brace of button-hooks,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<em>A host of cordial wishes for a prosperous new year,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>And a holiday edition of the “Rubaiyat,” de luxe.</em>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ve often heard that some there are⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How hard such tales are to believe!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To prove that costlier by far</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is to give than to receive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Christmas they present their friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With motor cars, and pearls in strings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blocks of stock with dividends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other useful little things.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I have no such benefits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I sing the Christmas spirit’s praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know the giver’s thrill⁠—for it’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A poor Yule which won’t work both ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<em>So I’LL give a laundry bag, of chintz refined, yet gay;</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>A tooth-brush container of a fanciful design,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<em>A flock of timely greetings for a snappy Christmas Day,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">

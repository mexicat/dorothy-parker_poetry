				<span>I hate Women.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my Nerves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are the Domestic ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the worst.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every moment is packed with Happiness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They breathe deeply</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And walk with large strides, eternally hurrying home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see about dinner.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who say, with a tender smile, “Money’s not everything.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always confronting me with dresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “I made this myself!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They read Woman’s pages and try out the recipes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how I hate that kind of women.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the human Sensitive Plants</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Bundles of Nerves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are different from everybody else; they even tell you so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Someone is always stepping on their feelings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything hurts them⁠—deeply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their eyes are forever filling with tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They always want to talk to me about the Real Things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The things that Matter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes, they know they could write.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conventions stifle them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always longing to get away⁠—Away from It All!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—I wish to Heaven they would.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then there are the Well-Informed ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are pests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know everything on earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will tell you about it gladly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They feel it their mission to correct wrong impressions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know Dates and Middle names.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They absolutely ooze Current Events.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how they bore me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the ones who simply cannot Fathom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why all the men are mad about them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say they’ve tried and tried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you about someone’s husband;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What he said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how he looked when he said it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they sigh and ask,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My dear, what is there about me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Don’t you hate them?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There are the unfailingly Cheerful ones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are usually unmarried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always busy making little Gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And planning little surprises.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell me to be, like them, always looking on the Bright Side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ask me what they would do without their sense of humor?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sometimes yearn to kill them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Any jury would acquit me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I hate women.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my Nerves.</span>

				<span>A wild and wicked gunman⁠—one who held a gang in thrall⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A menace to the lives of me and you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was counting up, exultingly, the day’s successful haul⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gunmen are extremely apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A string of pearls, a switch or two, a roll of bills, a ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some pocketbooks⁠—about a dozen, say⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An emerald tiara⁠—oh, a very pretty thing!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yes, really, quite a gratifying day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dainty little débutante came trippingly along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wistful, trusting eyes of baby blue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She softly hummed a fragment of a most Parisienne song⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As débutantes are very apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wild and wicked gunman felt he couldn’t miss the chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To end his busy day triumphantly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though scarcely in the habit of attacking débutantes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your money or your life, my dear,” said he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The dainty little débutante was trembling with alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appealingly she looked him through and through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid her helpless little hand upon his brawny arm⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As débutantes are very apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then earnestly she prayed the wicked gunman to be good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She begged that he’d reform that very day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he dropped his wicked gun, and promised that he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade her go her sweet and harmless way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wild and wicked gunman sat considering it all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“At last,” he cried, “I’ve met my Waterloo”;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He vowed he’d give to charity the day’s successful haul⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gunmen are extremely apt to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he tried to find his gains and give to those in want⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pocketbooks, the watches, bills and ring⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found, to his amazement, that the little débutante</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had taken every solitary thing!</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Lady in Back</h2>
			<p>
				<span>I don’t know what her name is, for you see, we’ve never met;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I don’t know if she’s dark, or if she’s fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know if she’s young or old, or rich or poor⁠—and yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever place I chance to go, she’s there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know where she came from, and I don’t know where she’ll go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why Fate has linked our lives I cannot see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world’s so full of people⁠—oh, I’d really like to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why must she <em>always</em> sit in back of me?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She’s always right on duty when I go to see a play⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfailingly, she’s seen that play before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so she tells what’s coming, in her entertaining way⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For me, the drama holds surprise no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now watch, the husband enters, as I told you that he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At first you’ll think he’ll shoot her, but he’ll not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And later she goes back to him, and says that she’ll be good,”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obligingly she thus unfolds the plot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When I am at the opera, of course she’s sure to come.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She there adopts another policy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The more familiar arias she feels obliged to hum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And always just a trifle off the key.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the singers reach those heights to which she can not climb⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh, then I plumb the very depths of gloom!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, lest I be too happy, she will occupy that time</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By long accounts of who’s in love with whom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I never can avoid her at the humble picture show⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of course, the film is always one she’s seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reliable as Mary’s lamb, she’s right behind, I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revealing all the secrets of the screen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When heroes tumble over cliffs, as movie heroes will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And villains blow up bridges, just for fun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know that she takes pleasure in extinguishing my thrill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By telling just exactly how it’s done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I really couldn’t tell you if she’s widow, maid, or wife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ve never heard about her family;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I don’t know who appointed her to take the joy from life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can’t imagine why she sees in me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I often sit and think of it, and wonder why it’s so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why, every place that I am, she is too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole wide world to choose from⁠—oh, I’d really like to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why can’t she <em>sometimes</em> sit in back of you?</span>

				<span>They end by appearing in a piece of court plaster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carrying a fan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the audience has to stand up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The band is always considered a success</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they climb into a flower-wreathed swing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swing out over the orchestra⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, that I might be there when the ropes break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND there are the Emotional Ones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ones who say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I’ll have two lumps of sugar in my tea, please,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In exactly the same tones as they deliver their hair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yes, he’ll wail murdered him!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever tearing their hair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hope it hurts them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always thinking.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Usually of the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hurl themselves on the floor at his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say that they wish it were all over⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They said something.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are the child Actresses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who should be seen and not heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around telling people about Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if they were special correspondents.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always climbing up on innocent bystanders</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And calling them they look so sad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They eternally bring their fathers and mothers together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is always an error of judgment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around patting people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then kneel down beside the orchestra leader,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say their prayers to the spotlight man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish I were Commodore Gerry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I hate Actresses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my nerves.</span>

			<p>
				<span>I hate Relatives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cramp my style.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are Aunts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even the best of us have them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always popping in for little visits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when you ask them to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take it seriously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never fail to tell you how badly you look;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they relate little anecdotes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About friends of theirs who went into Declines.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their conversation consists entirely of Insides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are never out of a Critical Condition.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always posing for X-Ray portraits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of parts of their anatomy with names like parlor-cars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say the doctor tells them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they have only one chance in a hundred⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The odds aren’t big enough.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are In-Laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Necessary Evils of Matrimony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only things they don’t say about you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are the ones they can’t pronounce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No matter what you do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know a better way to do it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are eternally searching your house for dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they can’t find any,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a wasted day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always getting their feelings hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that they can go around with martyred expressions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say that you will appreciate them when they’re gone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You certainly will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are Nephews;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the lowest form of animal life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are forever saying bright things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is no known force that can keep them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From reciting little pieces about Our Flag.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have the real Keystone sense of humor⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always firing things off in your ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pulling away the chair you are about to sit on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever you are striving to impress anyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They always appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And try out the new words they learned from the ice-man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish the Government would draft all males under ten!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND then there are Husbands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The White Woman’s Burden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never notice when you wear anything new⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You have to point it out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you about the deal they put through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the approach they made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you are supposed to get all worked up.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always hanging around outside your door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are incessantly pulling out watches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saying, “Aren’t you dressed yet?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were never known to be wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything is always your fault.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whenever you go out to have a good time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You always meet them⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish to Heaven somebody would alienate their affections.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I hate Relatives.</span>

			<p>
				<span>I HATE Slackers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my nerves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are the Conscientious Objectors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the real German atrocities.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They go around saying, “War is a terrible thing,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were an original line.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take the war as a personal affront;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They didn’t start it⁠—and that lets them out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They point out how much harder it is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stay at home and take care of their consciences</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to go and have some good, clean fun in a nice, comfortable trench.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They explain that it isn’t a matter of mere bravery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They only wish they had the chance to suffer for their convictions⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hope to God they get their wish!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THEN there are the Socialists;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Professional Bad Sports.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They don’t want to have any fun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anybody else has more than two dollars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They consider it a criminal offense.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They look as if the chambermaid forgot to dust them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is something about their political views</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes them wear soiled décolleté shirts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are too full of the spirit of brotherhood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ask any fellow creature to cut their hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are always telling their troubles to the New Republic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forever blocking the traffic with parades.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anyone disagrees with them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They immediately go on strike.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will prove⁠—with a street corner and a soap box⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the whole darned war was Morgan’s fault⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boy, page an alienist.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>THERE are the Pacifists;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have chronic stiff necks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From turning the other cheek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say they don’t believe in war⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were Santa Claus or the Stork.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will do anything on earth to have peace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except go out and win it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the only people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who disapprove of war;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everybody else thinks it’s perfectly great⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Allies are only fighting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because it keeps them out in the open air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know that if we’d all go around wearing lilies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And simply refusing to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Kaiser would take his army and go right back home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s all wrong, Pershing, it’s all wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>AND then there are the Men of Affairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ones who are too busy to fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Business is too good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men aren’t needed yet, anyway⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wait till the Germans come over here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell you it would be just their luck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose an eye or four fingers in a training camp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then have peace declared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It isn’t as if they hadn’t dependents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wives’ relatives can barely buy tires for the Rolls-Royce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of course, they may be called in the draft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they know they can easily get themselves exempted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because they have every symptom of hay fever⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wish I were head of the draft board!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I HATE Slackers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They get on my nerves.</span>
